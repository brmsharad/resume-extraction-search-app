Generally big companies get a lot of job applications, it becomes tough for the HR department to match the correct person with required skill set for an opening in the company. I propose a Resume Extraction and Search Application which can take in resumes submitted by job seekers in different common resume file formats like Microsoft word, Open Office Document,PDF,XML resume formats and HTML and parse the resumes and store them in the database and provide a search interface for efficiently searching the resumes for matching skills sets of the job requirements. This application takes resumes in a standard layout and format. A resume builder which creates the resumes in the format required for this application will also be provided as part for this application
